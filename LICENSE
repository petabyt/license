I don't care. It’s yours to do whatever.

There are a few catches though.

  No warranty.

That’s right, if your workstation blows up during installation, that’s on you.

If you break your collarbone trying to use the UI, that's all your fault.

If you flip your desk on yourself because the name of my variable offends you,
that's friggin weird, and you need to see a doctor.
