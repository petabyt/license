# My License
Pufflegamerz/Petabyte/Brikbusters 2015-

My software is free. You can do whatever you want with it.  
You can print it, eat it, throw it at your friends or burn it.  
I don't care. It’s yours to do whatever.

There are a few catches though.  

**No warranty.**

That’s right, if your workstation blows up during installation, that’s on you.  

If you break your collarbone trying to use the UI, that's all your fault.  

If you flip your desk on yourself because the name of my variable offends you,  
that's friggin weird, and you need to see a doctor.

**I am not responsible for your nuclear detonations or emotional breakdowns.**

And if you want to redistribute the code, you must include this license  
within the program.  

This applies for all the code I have written that I have not
chosen a license for. Got a problem with that? Too bad.
