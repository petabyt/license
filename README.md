This software is free. You can do whatever you want with it. 
You can print it, eat it, throw it at your friends or burn it. I don’t care.
It is yours to do whatever you want with it.

What’s the catch?
No warranty.

That’s right, if your workstation blows up during installation, that’s on you. If you break your foot trying to use the UI, that’s all your fault. I am not responsible for nuclear detonations or any limbs lost.
