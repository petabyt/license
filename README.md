# The "Danielicense"
My software is free. You can do whatever you want with it.  
You can print it, eat it, throw it at your friends or burn it.  
I don't care. It’s yours to do whatever.

There is one thing though:
**No warranty.**

That’s right, if your workstation blows up during installation, that’s on you.  

If you break your collarbone trying to use the UI, that's all your fault.  

If you flip your desk on yourself because the name of my variable offends you,  
that's friggin weird, and you need to see a doctor.

**I am not responsible for your nuclear detonations or emotional breakdowns.**

This applies for all the code I have written that I  
was too lazy to specify a license for. Got a problem with that? Too bad.  

> Of course this is not a license, but  
more of a legal note.  
**The real license I'm using for  
anything that does not already 
have a license is the GNU General Public License v2.0.**
