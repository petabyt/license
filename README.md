# The "Danielicense"
My software is free. You can do whatever you want with it. 
You can print it, eat it, throw it at your friends or burn it. I don't care.
It’s yours to do whatever you want with it.

There is one catch:
No warranty.

That’s right, if your workstation blows up during installation, that’s on you. 
If you break your collarbone trying to use the UI, that's all your fault. 
I am not responsible for your nuclear detonations or any limbs lost.
#
This applies for all the code I have written that I 
was too lazy to specify a license for.
#
Oh, and the danielicense is licensed under the danielicense.
